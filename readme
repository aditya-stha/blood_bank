🩸 Blood Donor Finder

A web app to connect blood donors with people in need in real time.

Project Overview

Blood emergencies can happen anytime, and finding the right donor quickly is critical.  
Blood Donor Finder is a lightweight, user-friendly web app that allows:

- Donors to register their blood type and contact information.  
- Seekers to filter donors by blood type and reach out immediately.  
- Fast connection without relying on outdated blood bank records.  

 This project was inspired during the **Nepali Gen Z protests, when many people urgently needed blood but blood banks were not updated or accessible. It was built to **bridge the gap between donors and seekers quickly and efficiently**.

Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 5), JavaScript  
- **Data Source:** Google Sheets (as a lightweight database)  
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages  
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile devices  

 Features

- Filter by blood type – find the right donor instantly.  
- Clickable phone links – call donors directly from the web page.  
- Register as a donor – seamless form integration using Google Forms.  
- Mobile-friendly layout – flexible and responsive design.  

 Usage

1. Visit the live site: [Blood Donor Finder](https://adityastha.github.io/blooddonorfinder/)  
2. Select a blood type from the dropdown.  
3. View matching donors and contact them instantly via phone.  
4. Want to donate? Click **“Register as Donor”** to fill out the form.  

 Future Improvements notes for me

- Add city/location filter for nearby donors.  
- Implement last donation date to improve eligibility info.  
- Add notifications for urgent blood requests.  
- Integrate a real database (Firebase, Airtable) for scalability.  

Impact

Even in its MVP version, Blood Donor Finder has the potential to:

- Reduce time to connect donors with seekers.  
- Increase participation of volunteers in local communities.  
- Serve as a foundation for a larger, nationwide blood donation network.
