# 🩸 Blood Donor Finder

**A web app to connect blood donors with people in need in real time.**

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

Blood emergencies can happen anytime, and finding the right donor quickly is critical.  
**Blood Donor Finder** is a lightweight, user-friendly web app that allows:

- Donors to register their blood type and contact information.  
- Seekers to filter donors by blood type and reach out immediately.  
- Fast connection without relying on outdated blood bank records.  

**Inspiration:** This project was inspired during the **Nepali Gen Z protests**, when many people urgently needed blood but blood banks were not updated or accessible. It was built to **bridge the gap between donors and seekers quickly and efficiently**.
